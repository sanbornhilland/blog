  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm Sanborn. I'm a JavaScript developer mostly working on client side video
    streaming applications. I write about web development mostly to teach myself. 
    With any luck it will be useful for others as well.
    </br>
    Outside of development you can often find me at the local climbing gym, teaching
    web development, camping, or flopped on the couch being lazy.
